# Training Fund Management .NET Project

The Training Fund Management .NET project is a part of our internship program, aimed at providing hands-on experience in developing a web-based fund management system using the .NET framework.

## Project Overview

The Training Fund Management project is designed to help manage funds allocated for training programs. The system allows administrators to track and allocate funds to different training initiatives, monitor expenditures, and generate reports for analysis. It provides features such as user management, fund allocation, expense tracking, and reporting.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET WEB API**: The project is built using the ASP.NET MVC framework, which provides a powerful and flexible architecture for web application development.
- **C#**: The primary programming language used for implementing the project's logic and functionality.
